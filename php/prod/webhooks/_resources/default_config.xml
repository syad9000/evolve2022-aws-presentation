Example config when you are getting some files to store on S3 and keeping your original production server.
Files are obtained via GET requests. The REMOVE_TXT will usually be the HTTP_ROOT of your site. 
This is needed because the POST from the OmniCMS webhook will have the full URL in the filename.  You use this
full URL to do the GET request, but remove it to post to Amazon S3
